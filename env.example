# This is an example environment file that allows anonymous access
# to the MQTT broker.
# Take a look at the provided "env.-with-auth.example" file if you
# want to use mosquitto with authentication.
#
# Copy the contents of this file to a file named ".env" and set there
# your settings as necessary, e.g. "cp env.example .env".
#
# The ".env" file will be used by docker-compose to set environment
# variables for the containers.

# to the source code result in a recompile and restart of the integrator.
# The development mode is fine for development purposes, but should not be
# used in production. If you want to start the integrator in production your
# start command could look like this:
#
# bash -c 'mvn clean package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar -D quarkus.package.output-name=integrator -DskipTests && java -jar target/integrator-runner.jar'
