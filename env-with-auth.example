# This is an example environment file with authentication check in mosquitto.
# Take a look at the provided "env.example" file if you don't need authentication
# in mosquitto.
#
# Copy the contents of this file to a file named ".env" and set there
# your settings as necessary, e.g. "cp env-with-auth.example .env".
#
# The ".env" file will be used by docker-compose to set environment
# variables for the containers.

# mosquitto configuration file to use. The mosquitto-with-auth.conf below

# Please take a look at https://mosquitto.org/documentation/authentication-methods/
